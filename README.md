If there's one thing college students deserve, it's good food. And Bryn Mawr does a pretty good job.
But their website sucks. I mean, [seriously](http://www.brynmawr.edu/dining/menu.htm)? 
So I scraped the two mobile friendly pages to create a prettier version. Because if there's one other
thing college students deserve, it's a beautiful dining hall menu.
